📈 PHASE-39 — Customer Experience Analytics

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 39 — Customer Experience Analytics
Status: 🟢 Active & Measured
Environment: Production
Owner: Product, Platform & Customer Success
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Measure, understand, and continuously improve end-to-end customer experience (CX) across the LocalizeVideos platform using actionable analytics.

This phase ensures decisions are guided by real user behavior, not assumptions.

Performance is technical. Experience is human.

🧠 Guiding Principles

Customer outcomes over internal metrics

Friction visibility over vanity

Privacy-first analytics

Trends over snapshots

Insights must lead to action

Analytics exist to improve experience—not to surveil users.

🧩 CX Measurement Scope

Customer experience analytics cover:

Onboarding & activation

Core product workflows

Authentication & sessions

Performance & responsiveness

Error handling & recoverability

Support touchpoints

👤 Customer Journey Mapping

Key journey stages to measure:

Discovery & Signup

Login & Authentication

First Successful Action

Repeat Usage

Problem Encounter

Support Interaction

Resolution & Retention

Each stage must have defined signals.

📊 Core CX Metrics (KPIs)
Activation & Adoption
Metric	Description	Target
Time to First Value (TTFV)	Signup → first success	↓
Activation Rate	Users completing core flow	↑
Feature Adoption	Usage of key features	↑
Performance & Reliability
Metric	Description	Target
Page Load Time	User-perceived speed	↓
API Latency	Backend responsiveness	↓
Error Rate	User-facing failures	↓
Retry Success Rate	Recovery effectiveness	↑
Authentication Experience
Metric	Description	Target
Login Success Rate	Successful auth attempts	↑
Session Expiry Issues	Unexpected logouts	↓
Auth Error Frequency	User-facing auth errors	↓

Authentication friction directly impacts trust.

Support Experience
Metric	Description	Target
Tickets per Active User	Support load	↓
Time to Resolution	Issue closure speed	↓
Repeat Tickets	Unresolved root causes	↓
CSAT	Customer satisfaction	↑

Support signals often reflect product gaps.

🔐 Privacy & Ethics

CX analytics must adhere to:

Data minimization

No sensitive payload logging

No PII exposure

Aggregation where possible

Transparency to users

Tracking without consent or purpose is prohibited.

📣 Feedback Channels

Customer feedback sources include:

In-app feedback

Support tickets

Post-resolution surveys

Enterprise QBRs

Direct customer interviews

Qualitative feedback complements quantitative metrics.

🔁 Insight → Action Loop

Analyze CX metrics

Identify friction points

Prioritize improvements

Implement changes

Measure impact

Every insight must have an owner.

📈 Reporting & Reviews

Weekly: CX trend review (product team)

Monthly: CX metrics summary (leadership)

Quarterly: Deep-dive & roadmap alignment

Reports must show before/after comparisons.

🚫 Prohibited Practices

❌ Tracking without purpose
❌ Storing raw sensitive events
❌ Vanity metrics without decisions
❌ Ignoring negative CX signals
❌ Treating support pain as “normal”

🏁 Outcome
