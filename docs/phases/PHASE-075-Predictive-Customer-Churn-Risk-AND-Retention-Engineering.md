🔁 PHASE-75 — Predictive Customer Churn Risk & Retention Engineering

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 75 — Predictive Customer Churn Risk & Retention Engineering
Status: 🟡 Planned / Customer Intelligence & Revenue Protection
Environment: Production
Owner: Customer Success, Data, Product, SRE, Executive Leadership
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Prevent revenue loss by predicting customer churn before it happens and activating targeted retention mechanisms that:

Identify early churn signals across product, reliability, and engagement

Quantify churn risk per customer and segment

Trigger proactive interventions before dissatisfaction becomes cancellation

Align engineering, product, and customer success around retention outcomes

Retention is cheaper than acquisition — but only if it’s proactive.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Churn is a lagging indicator.
Signals always appear before a customer leaves.

PHASE-75 ensures:

No churn is a surprise

Risk is continuously quantified

Interventions are timely and personalized

Retention decisions are data-driven, not reactive

Dashboards include:

Churn risk distribution

Revenue-at-risk

Intervention effectiveness

Retention rate trends

Time-to-intervention metrics

Reports are sales, product, and exec-ready.

📈 Success Metrics

PHASE-75 is successful when:

Churn rate declines measurably

High-risk churn is intercepted early

Retention interventions outperform control groups

Revenue predictability improves

Customer trust scores rise

🧠 Cultural Rule

If a customer churns without warning, the signal was ignored.
