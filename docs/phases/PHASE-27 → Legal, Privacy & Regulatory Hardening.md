⚖️ PHASE-27 — Legal, Privacy & Regulatory Hardening

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 27 — Legal, Privacy & Regulatory Hardening
Status: 🟡 Planned → 🟢 Enforced (Progressive)
Environment: Production
Owner: Governance, Legal & Security
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Establish a strong legal, privacy, and regulatory foundation that protects:

The company

The platform

Customers and users

Enterprise and regulatory relationships

This phase ensures LocalizeVideos is legally defensible, privacy-respecting, and audit-ready.

A technically strong platform without legal hardening is fragile.

🧠 Guiding Principles

LocalizeVideos follows these principles:

Privacy by design

Transparency over obscurity

Least legal exposure

Regulatory alignment, not avoidance

Documented accountability

If it is not written, it does not exist legally.

📜 Legal Policy Framework

The following documents are mandatory and must be publicly accessible:

Core Legal Documents

Terms of Service

Privacy Policy

Cookie Policy

Acceptable Use Policy

Refund & Cancellation Policy (if applicable)

All policies must:

Be versioned

Have a last-updated date

Be approved before production rollout

🔐 Privacy & Data Protection
Personal Data Handling

Minimal data collection

Explicit purpose declaration

No dark patterns

No hidden data usage

Cookies & Tracking

Auth cookies: strictly necessary

No third-party trackers without consent

Analytics must be privacy-aware

User Consent

Explicit consent where required

Implied consent only for essential operations

Consent revocation supported

🌍 Regulatory Alignment

LocalizeVideos aligns with the following frameworks:

GDPR (EU)

Lawful processing

Right to erasure

Right to access

Data minimization

Breach notification readiness

Indian IT & DPDP Act (India)

Lawful data collection

Purpose limitation

Secure processing

User grievance mechanism

SOC 2 (Preparation)

Access control

🧾 Data Processing Agreements (DPA)

Breach notification timelines

Sub-processor rules

No DPA → No enterprise onboarding.

🚨 Breach & Legal Incident Response

All incidents follow a defined legal escalation path:

Identify incident

Contain impact

Preserve evidence

Notify stakeholders (if required)

Document resolution

Legal counsel must be involved for:

Data breaches

Law enforcement requests

Regulatory notices

🧑‍⚖️ Law Enforcement & Government Requests

Policy:

Requests must be formal and documented

No voluntary disclosure

No informal data sharing

Legal review required

All requests logged securely.

📂 Documentation Structure

All legal and regulatory documents must live under:

❌ Prohibited Practices

❌ Silent policy changes
