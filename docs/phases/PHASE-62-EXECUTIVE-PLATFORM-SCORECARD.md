Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 62 — Executive Platform Scorecard
Status: 🟡 Planned / Governance
Environment: Production
Owner: Executive Team, Engineering Leadership, Product, Finance
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Create a single, executive-level scorecard that provides a clear, truthful, and real-time view of the health of the LocalizeVideos platform.

This phase ensures leadership can:

Make fast, informed decisions

Detect risk early

Measure execution against strategy

Avoid blind spots hidden in operational noise

If leadership cannot see reality clearly, the platform is already at risk.

🧠 Core Principle

Executives do not need more data.
Executives need the right signals.

The scorecard must be:

Simple

Trustworthy

Actionable

Impossible to game

🚦 Status Definitions
Status	Meaning
🟢 Green	Operating within defined targets

Truth > Comfort.

🛑 Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN)

❌ Overly technical dashboards
❌ Metrics without owners
❌ Lagging-only indicators
❌ Manual, cherry-picked reports
❌ Status optimism without evidence

🏁 Outcome
