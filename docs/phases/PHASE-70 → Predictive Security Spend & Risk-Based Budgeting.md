🛡️ PHASE-70 — Predictive Security Spend & Risk-Based Budgeting

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 70 — Predictive Security Spend & Risk-Based Budgeting
Status: 🟡 Planned / Executive Security Economics
Environment: Production
Owner: Security Engineering, SRE, FinOps, Executive Leadership
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Transform security spending from reactive, fear-driven costs into a predictive, risk-aligned investment strategy that:

Funds real risk, not hypothetical threats

Anticipates future security costs before incidents

Aligns security spend with business exposure

Enables executives to make informed, defensible decisions

Security is not a cost center — it is risk insurance with measurable ROI.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Not all risks deserve equal spending.

PHASE-70 ensures:

High-risk areas receive priority funding

Low-risk areas are not over-protected

Security budgets scale with exposure, not panic

Every security dollar has a risk justification

🧮 Risk-Based Budget Allocation
Risk Tier	Example	Budget Priority
Critical	Auth, data access, payments	Highest
High	API abuse, privilege escalation	High
Medium	Rate limits, bot protection	Medium
Low	Cosmetic hardening	Minimal

Spending follows risk, not intuition.

💸 Security Spend Categories

Identity & Access Management

Application Security

Infrastructure Hardening

Monitoring & Detection

Incident Response

Compliance & Audit

Security Training

Each category has:

Target ROI

Risk reduction score

Sunset criteria

🤖 Automation vs Human Oversight
Scenario	Action
Low cost, proven control	Auto-approve
Medium cost	Security review
High cost	Executive approval
Unclear benefit	Reject or pilot

Security automation enforces consistency.
Humans set risk appetite.

📜 Audit & Executive Reporting

Quarterly reports include:

Risk reduction achieved

Spend vs exposure

Controls added / removed

Incident prevention metrics

Budget reallocation rationale

Reports are board-ready by default.

📈 Success Metrics

PHASE-70 is successful when:

Security spend correlates with reduced incidents

Budget discussions are data-driven

Over-spending on low-risk areas declines

High-risk areas show measurable hardening

Executives trust security forecasts

🧠 Cultural Rule

If security spending cannot be justified in risk terms, it is waste.
