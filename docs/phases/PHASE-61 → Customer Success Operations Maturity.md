Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 61 — Customer Success Operations Maturity
Status: 🟡 Planned / Strategic
Environment: Production
Owner: Customer Success, Support, Product, Engineering
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Build a mature, scalable Customer Success (CS) operation that ensures:

Customers achieve measurable value

Issues are resolved predictably

Trust increases with scale

Enterprise customers feel supported, not abandoned

This phase formalizes Customer Success as a core operational system, not an ad-hoc support function.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Customer Success is not:

Just support tickets

Just response time

Just “being nice”

Customer Success is:

A measurable system that ensures customers continuously realize value from the platform.

🧩 Customer Success Maturity Levels
Level	Description
Reactive	Only responds to issues
Managed	Tickets, SLAs, basic reporting
Proactive	Health scores, outreach
Predictive	Churn prevention, signals
Strategic	CS drives roadmap & growth

LocalizeVideos targets Predictive → Strategic maturity.

🛠️ Core CS Capabilities (Required)
🎟️ Support Operations

Centralized ticketing system

Priority-based queues

Clear ownership per ticket

Defined escalation paths

⏱️ SLAs & Response

First Response Time (FRT)

Resolution Time

Severity-based SLAs

SLA breach alerts

📊 Customer Health Monitoring

Usage trends

Error frequency

Support interaction volume

Engagement signals

Health scores must be visible and actionable.

🔁 Proactive Customer Success

Mandatory practices:

Early warning alerts for churn risk

Outreach before customers complain

Scheduled check-ins for enterprise accounts

Clear onboarding milestones

No enterprise customer should be surprised by a problem.

🔐 Security & Trust Integration

Customer Success must:

Coordinate during incidents

Communicate transparently

Follow approved incident comms

Never speculate or over-promise

Trust is preserved through clarity and consistency.

📊 Metrics That Matter

Required CS metrics:

Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Time to Resolution

Churn rate

Expansion / retention rate

Metrics without action plans are noise.

🧭 Escalation & Ownership Model

Every customer must have:

A clear success owner

An escalation path

A known decision-maker contact

No “shared inbox” ownership in enterprise contexts.

🧠 Feedback Loop to Product & Engineering

Customer Success insights must feed:

Bug prioritization

UX improvements

Feature requests

Roadmap decisions

Customer pain is product signal, not support noise.

🚦 Governance Rules

No SLA changes without leadership approval

No promises outside documented capabilities

No customer-specific hacks without review

No ignoring repeated customer pain points

Customer Success is a governed discipline.

🛑 Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)

❌ Treating CS as cost center only
❌ Measuring success only by ticket volume
❌ Ignoring silent customers
❌ Over-promising to close deals
❌ Manual, hero-driven support

🏁 Outcome

After PHASE-61, LocalizeVideos achieves:

Predictable customer experience

Reduced churn and escalations

Strong enterprise confidence

Clear ownership and accountability

Customer trust as a competitive advantage
