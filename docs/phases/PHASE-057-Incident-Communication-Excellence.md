📣 PHASE-57 — Incident Communication Excellence

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 57 — Incident Communication Excellence
Status: 🟡 Planned / Governance
Environment: Production
Owner: Executive Leadership, Product, SRE, Support
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Establish clear, calm, accurate, and trusted communication during incidents—internally and externally—so that confidence is preserved while issues are resolved.

This phase ensures communication reduces uncertainty, not amplifies it.

Silence erodes trust. Noise destroys it. Clarity builds it.

🧠 Core Principle

During incidents:

Accuracy > Speed

Clarity > Completeness

Consistency > Volume

Communication must be intentional, centralized, and factual.

🧭 Communication Audiences

Incident communication must address four audiences, each with different needs:

Incident Response Team

Internal Stakeholders

Customers

External Parties (partners, regulators, media if applicable)

Each audience receives tailored messaging.

🗂️ Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
Mandatory Rule

All incident updates must originate from one authoritative channel.

Examples:

Incident channel / war room

Status page

Official incident document

Side channels are forbidden.

🚦 Incident Communication Roles
Incident Commander

Owns update cadence

Approves all messages

Ensures accuracy

Communications Lead (if assigned)

Drafts messages

Coordinates delivery

Maintains consistency

Executives

Support, do not override

Communicate only via approved channels

⏱️ Update Cadence Guidelines
Severity	Update Frequency
SEV-1	Every 15–30 minutes
SEV-2	Every 30–60 minutes
SEV-3	As needed

No update is better than speculative updates.

🧾 Message Structure (Required)

Every incident update must include:

What happened (known facts only)

Impact (who is affected)

Current status (what we are doing now)

Next update time (even if no change)

Avoid:

Root cause speculation

Technical jargon for external audiences

Promises without certainty

🗣️ Tone & Language Standards
Required

Calm

Neutral

Empathetic

Honest

Forbidden

❌ Blame
❌ Panic language
❌ Overconfidence
❌ Minimization of impact

Trust is built through respectful transparency.

🌐 External Communication (Customers)
Rules

Never surprise customers

Acknowledge impact clearly

Avoid internal complexity

Do not disclose sensitive details

Approved Channels

Status page

Official emails

In-app banners (if applicable)

🏛️ Regulatory / Legal Communication

If applicable:

Coordinate with legal before public statements

Preserve factual timelines

Avoid admissions of fault

Accuracy protects the organization.

🔁 Post-Incident Communication

After resolution:

Publish a clear incident summary

Share learnings (as appropriate)

Explain what will change

Closure matters as much as response.

🧪 Preparedness & Training

Teams must practice:

Message drafting under pressure

Executive alignment drills

Customer-facing simulations

Unpracticed communication fails when it matters most.

🛑 Anti-Patterns (Explicitly Forbidden)

❌ Multiple conflicting updates
❌ Executive side messages
❌ Technical deep-dives to customers
❌ Over-promising recovery times
❌ Silence after resolution

🏁 Outcome

After PHASE-57, LocalizeVideos achieves:

Higher customer trust during incidents

Reduced confusion and rumor spread

Faster, calmer incident resolution

Stronger brand credibility

Aligned leadership communication
