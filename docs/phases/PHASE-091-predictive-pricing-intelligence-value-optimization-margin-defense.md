Phase: 91 — Predictive Pricing Intelligence, Value Optimization & Margin Defense
Status: 🟡 Planned / Pricing Intelligence & Margin Protection
Environment: Production
Owner: Product, Growth, Finance (FinOps), Executive
Last Updated: 2025-12-28

🎯 Objective

Protect and grow margins by predicting pricing pressure, value misalignment, and margin erosion before revenue is impacted, enabling:

Proactive pricing adjustments

Value-aligned packaging and tiers

Early detection of discount overuse

Defense against competitive and cost pressure

This phase ensures pricing reflects value, not fear.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Pricing failure is silent margin death.

PHASE-91 ensures:

Price reflects delivered value

Discounts are intentional, not habitual

Cost increases don’t quietly erase margin

Leadership sees margin risk early

🧮 Margin Risk Scoring

Each plan / segment is scored on:

Margin contribution

Discount dependency

Cost volatility

Price sensitivity

Competitive exposure

Output:

Increase price / repackage

Defend current pricing

Targeted discounting

Sunset / redesign

Margin defense is strategic, not reactive.

🛡️ Value Optimization Strategies
Strategy	Effect
Outcome-based pricing	Align value
Tier realignment	Reduce leakage
Usage caps & overages	Protect margin
Discount governance	Prevent erosion
Price testing	Validate willingness-to-pay

Pricing changes are measured, not impulsive.

🚦 Governance Rules

Allowed:

Value-based pricing

Controlled pricing experiments

Margin-aware discounting

Prohibited:

Blanket discounting

Panic price cuts

Ignoring cost-to-serve drift

Pricing is strategy, not sales relief.

📈 Success Metrics

PHASE-91 is successful when:

Gross margin stabilizes or improves

Discount usage declines

Expansion revenue increases

Pricing confidence improves

Leadership trusts pricing decisions

🧠 Cultural Rule

If discounts feel easy, value is unclear.
If margin shrinks silently, pricing failed.
