🔐 PHASE-34 — Security Incident Tabletop Exercises

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 34 — Security Incident Tabletop Exercises
Status: 🟢 Active & Recurring
Environment: Production
Owner: Security, Platform & Leadership
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Establish structured, repeatable tabletop exercises to ensure the LocalizeVideos team can respond calmly, correctly, and decisively to security incidents.

This phase validates that people, process, and tooling work together under pressure.

Incidents are inevitable. Chaos is optional.

🧠 Guiding Principles

Practice beats theory

People fail before systems

Clear roles reduce panic

Decisions must be rehearsed

Learning over blame

Tabletop exercises are training tools, not audits.

🧩 Scope of Exercises

Exercises cover scenarios involving:

Unauthorized access

Credential compromise

Data exposure

Infrastructure breach

Insider threat

Third-party compromise

Regulatory breach notifications

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Participants & Roles

Each exercise must include:

Incident Commander (decision authority)

Security Lead

Platform / Infra Lead

Communications Owner

Observer / Scribe

Roles must be assigned before the exercise begins.

📋 Exercise Format

Each tabletop follows this structure:

Scenario briefing

Incident discovery moment

Progressive information reveals

Decision checkpoints

Resolution discussion

Post-exercise review

No technical actions are taken during tabletop exercises.

🔥 Standard Tabletop Scenarios
Scenario 1 — Credential Compromise

Stolen admin credentials detected

Suspicious API activity observed

Fail2Ban triggers present

Focus Areas

Access revocation

Session invalidation

Customer impact assessment

Scenario 2 — Data Exposure Risk

Logs suspected to contain sensitive data

External report received

No confirmation yet

Focus Areas

Evidence handling

Exposure validation

Legal notification timing

Scenario 3 — Infrastructure Breach

Unexpected outbound traffic

Unrecognized process behavior

Elevated permissions detected

Focus Areas

Containment strategy

Service continuity

Forensic preservation

Scenario 4 — Third-Party Vendor Incident

Vendor reports breach

Potential downstream impact

Focus Areas

Dependency assessment

Customer communication

Contractual obligations

⏱️ Decision Checkpoints

Each scenario must force decisions on:

Incident severity classification

Escalation timing

Customer notification threshold

System isolation vs availability

Legal involvement timing

Decisions are documented, not judged.

📣 Communication Simulation

Exercises must simulate:

Internal escalation

Executive notification

Customer messaging

Regulatory notification triggers

Messaging accuracy is evaluated.

🧾 Documentation & Artifacts

Each exercise must produce:

Scenario summary

Timeline of decisions

Gaps identified

Action items

Owner assignments

Artifacts must be stored and versioned.

🔁 Frequency & Cadence

Quarterly: Full tabletop exercise

After major incidents: Targeted tabletop

After major architectural changes: Scenario refresh

Skipping exercises is not permitted.

🚫 Prohibited Practices

❌ Treating exercises as optional
❌ Blame-focused discussions
❌ Skipping documentation
❌ Ignoring identified gaps
❌ Repeating scenarios without updates

🏁 Outcome

After PHASE-34, LocalizeVideos achieves:

Faster incident response

Clear decision ownership

Reduced panic during real incidents

Improved communication quality

Stronger security culture
