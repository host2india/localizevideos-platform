🎧 PHASE-36 — Enterprise Support Operations

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 36 — Enterprise Support Operations
Status: 🟢 Active & Enforced
Environment: Production
Owner: Support, Platform & Customer Success
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Establish a structured, scalable, and SLA-aligned enterprise support model that ensures:

Predictable response times

Clear escalation paths

Consistent customer experience

Reduced operational chaos

This phase transforms support from reactive firefighting into a controlled operational function.

Enterprise support is a system, not a mailbox.

🧠 Guiding Principles

Clarity beats urgency

Severity-driven response

Single source of truth

Escalation without panic

Every ticket leaves a trail

Support must be measurable, auditable, and repeatable.

🏢 Enterprise Support Scope

This phase covers:

Enterprise customer support requests

SLA-backed incident handling

Escalations & communications

Post-incident follow-ups

Knowledge capture & improvement

Self-serve customers are out of scope.

🎫 Ticket Intake & Channels
Approved Channels

Enterprise support requests must come through:

Official support portal

Approved enterprise email alias

Contractually defined channels

❌ Direct messages, personal emails, or informal channels are not supported.

🚦 Severity Classification

All tickets must be categorized:

Severity 1 — Critical

Platform down

Authentication failure

Data integrity risk

Severity 2 — High

Major feature degradation

Partial outage

Severity 3 — Medium

Non-critical feature issues

Severity 4 — Low

How-to questions

Configuration guidance

Severity determines response priority, not customer pressure.

⏱️ SLA Response Targets
Severity	Initial Response	Update Frequency
Sev 1	≤ 1 hour	Every 30–60 mins
Sev 2	≤ 4 hours	Every business day
Sev 3	≤ 1 business day	As needed
Sev 4	≤ 2 business days	As needed

Resolution speed depends on complexity.

🔁 Escalation Flow

Support Engineer

Platform Engineer

Security / Infra Lead

Leadership (if required)

Escalations must be documented and time-stamped.

📣 Communication Standards

During active incidents:

Single source of updates

Clear, factual messaging

No speculation

Consistent update cadence

Customer trust depends on communication quality.

🧾 Incident Closure & RCA

Every Sev 1 / Sev 2 incident requires:

Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Timeline of events

Impact assessment

Preventive actions

Owner assignment

RCAs must be shared internally.

📚 Knowledge Management

Support insights must feed into:

Runbooks

FAQs

Internal playbooks

Product improvements

Repeated issues indicate system gaps.

🔍 Metrics & Reporting

Support operations track:

Response times

SLA compliance

Ticket volume by severity

Repeat incidents

Customer satisfaction

Metrics are reviewed regularly.

🚫 Prohibited Practices

❌ Bypassing ticketing system
❌ Undocumented escalations
❌ Verbal-only resolutions
❌ Ignoring SLAs
❌ Permanent “temporary fixes”

🏁 Outcome

After PHASE-36, LocalizeVideos achieves:

Predictable enterprise support

Strong SLA adherence

Reduced escalations

Better customer confidence

Continuous operational improvement
