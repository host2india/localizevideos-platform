🚑 PHASE-88 — Predictive Incident Economics, User Impact & Recovery Optimization

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 88 — Predictive Incident Economics, User Impact & Recovery Optimization
Status: 🟡 Planned / Incident Economics & Recovery Intelligence
Environment: Production
Owner: SRE, Platform Engineering, Product, Support, Executive
Last Updated: 2025-12-28

🎯 Objective

Optimize incident response by predicting economic and user impact before, during, and after incidents, enabling:

Faster, value-aware recovery decisions

Prioritization based on user and revenue impact

Reduced recovery cost without sacrificing trust

Clear post-incident learning and prevention ROI

This phase ensures incidents are managed as economic events, not just technical failures.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Not all incidents are equal.

PHASE-88 ensures:

Recovery effort matches real impact

User pain is quantified, not guessed

Leadership understands incident cost in real time

Teams recover what matters most first

📥 Incident Signal Inputs
Technical Signals

Error rates & service degradation

Blast radius mapping

MTTR & MTTD trends

Dependency failure propagation

User Impact Signals

Affected users & segments

Feature criticality

Session drop-off & retries

Support ticket spikes

Economic Signals

Revenue at risk per minute

SLA penalty exposure

Churn probability uplift

Recovery cost (people + infra)

📊 Predictive Incident Economics Pipeline

Detect
→ Classify incident severity
→ Predict user & revenue impact
→ Model recovery scenarios
→ Prioritize recovery actions
→ Execute restoration
→ Review forecast vs actual

🧮 Incident Impact Scoring

Each incident is scored on:

User impact magnitude

Revenue exposure

Recovery complexity

Reputation risk

Recurrence probability

Output:

Critical — recover immediately

High — prioritize

Moderate

Low / defer

Severity is driven by impact, not noise.

🛠️ Recovery Optimization Strategies
Strategy	Benefit
Restore high-value paths first	Faster trust recovery
Traffic shaping	Limit damage
Feature degradation	Preserve core flows
Automated rollback	Reduce MTTR
Parallel recovery tracks	Faster resolution

Recovery is value-ordered, not FIFO.

🚦 Governance Rules

Allowed:

Impact-based incident prioritization

Economic-aware recovery decisions

Post-incident ROI analysis

Prohibited:

Vanity severity labels

Over-escalation without impact

Blame-driven reviews

Incidents are learning events, not failure rituals.

📈 Success Metrics

PHASE-88 is successful when:

MTTR drops for high-impact incidents

User impact is minimized consistently

Recovery effort aligns with value

Incident cost predictability improves

Leadership confidence during incidents increases

🧠 Cultural Rule

If every incident is “critical,” nothing is.
If recovery feels calm, intelligence is working.
