🧮 PHASE-78 — Predictive Product ROI & Feature Investment Governance

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 78 — Predictive Product ROI & Feature Investment Governance
Status: 🟡 Planned / Product Economics & Executive Decision Intelligence
Environment: Production
Owner: Product Management, Engineering, Finance, Data, Executive Leadership
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Ensure engineering effort, roadmap priorities, and product investments are driven by predictable ROI, not intuition, by:

Forecasting ROI before features are built

Governing feature investment with financial discipline

Preventing low-impact or vanity features

Aligning product decisions with revenue, retention, and cost efficiency

Every feature is an investment. Not every idea deserves capital.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Roadmaps are capital allocation plans, not wish lists.

PHASE-78 ensures:

Engineering time is treated as finite capital

Product bets are justified before commitment

Low-ROI features are deprioritized early

Long-term value outweighs short-term noise

🔍 Product ROI Signal Inputs
Demand Signals

Customer requests frequency

Enterprise deal blockers

Expansion and upsell signals

Market competitiveness gaps

Revenue Signals

Expected ARR uplift

Expansion conversion probability

Pricing tier impact

CLV influence

Retention Signals

Churn reduction potential

SLA risk mitigation

Customer satisfaction impact

Cost Signals

Engineering effort (build + maintain)

Infrastructure cost impact

Support and operational overhead

Compliance and security cost

Strategic Signals

Platform differentiation

Long-term architecture alignment

Regulatory enablement

Ecosystem leverage

🧮 Feature ROI Scoring Model
Dimension	Weight
Revenue impact	High
Retention / churn reduction	High
Engineering cost	High
Strategic leverage	Medium
Risk / uncertainty	Contextual

High engineering cost must justify proportional value.

🛠️ Feature Investment Governance
Auto-Approve

Low effort, high confidence ROI

Regulatory or security-mandated work

Conditional Approval

Medium ROI with strategic value

Experiments with capped scope

Executive Approval Required

High-cost initiatives

Platform refactors

Long-term roadmap bets

Reject

Low ROI

High maintenance, low leverage

Duplicate or vanity features

No feature bypasses governance.

🤖 Automation vs Human Judgment
Scenario	Handling
ROI estimation	Automated
Scoring & ranking	Automated
Strategic exceptions	Executive decision
Portfolio rebalancing	Human-led

Automation enforces discipline.
Humans define vision.

📜 Reporting & Accountability

Dashboards include:

Feature ROI forecasts vs actuals

Engineering capital allocation

Roadmap ROI distribution

Value leakage analysis

Kill-rate of low-ROI features

Product leadership is accountable for ROI accuracy, not just delivery.

📈 Success Metrics

PHASE-78 is successful when:

Feature ROI predictability improves

Low-impact features decrease

Engineering efficiency rises

Product roadmap aligns with business outcomes

Stakeholders trust roadmap decisions

🧠 Cultural Rule

If a feature ships without a value hypothesis, governance failed.
