Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 33 — Enterprise Onboarding & Enablement
Status: 🟢 Active & Standardized
Environment: Production
Owner: Product, Platform, Support & Sales Engineering
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Provide a repeatable, secure, and low-friction onboarding experience for enterprise customers while ensuring:

Faster time-to-value

Predictable operational load

Correct usage from day one

Reduced support escalations

Enterprise onboarding is not a signup — it is a controlled activation.

🧠 Guiding Principles

Consistency over customization

Enablement before scale

Security by default

Documentation over tribal knowledge

No production surprises

Every enterprise customer must follow the same baseline onboarding path.

🧩 Enterprise Onboarding Scope

This phase covers:

Contract handoff → Platform activation

Identity & access setup

Environment readiness

Feature enablement

Customer education

Operational handover

📥 Pre-Onboarding Requirements (Mandatory)

Before onboarding begins, the following must be completed:

Signed contract / SLA

Approved data residency region

Named customer admin contacts

Support escalation contacts

Security questionnaire (if required)

Onboarding must not proceed without these items.

🛠️ Onboarding Workflow
Step 1 — Internal Readiness Check

Confirm production stability

Confirm capacity availability

Confirm compliance alignment

Assign onboarding owner

No customer actions occur before this step.

Step 2 — Account Provisioning

Create enterprise account

Assign admin roles

Apply contractual feature flags

Enforce security defaults

No shared or reused accounts are allowed.

Step 3 — Access & Identity Setup

Admin authentication verified

Role-based access validated

Token / session behavior tested

Logout & session expiry verified

Security validation is mandatory before go-live.

Step 4 — Environment Validation

API health checks

Database connectivity confirmed

Rate limits verified

Logging visibility confirmed

Failures here block onboarding progression.

Step 5 — Feature Enablement

Enable only contracted features

Validate permissions

Confirm UI visibility

Test critical user flows

No hidden or experimental features for enterprise tenants.

Step 6 — Customer Enablement

Provide:

Product walkthrough

Admin usage guide

Security best practices

Support process overview

Enablement is required before production usage.

Step 7 — Go-Live Confirmation

Customer sign-off

Platform sign-off

Support readiness confirmed

Monitoring verified

Go-live date must be recorded.

📚 Documentation Provided to Customers

Enterprise customers receive:

Product overview

Admin guide

Security posture summary

SLA & support expectations

Incident communication process

All documentation must be versioned and current.

📞 Support & Escalation Model

Enterprise customers are assigned:

Primary support channel

Escalation contacts

Severity definitions

Response expectations

No informal or ad-hoc support channels are permitted.

🔁 Post-Onboarding Review

Within 30 days:

Review usage patterns

Identify enablement gaps

Validate performance

Capture feedback

Findings must be documented.

🚫 Prohibited Practices

❌ Skipping onboarding steps
❌ Manual production tweaks
❌ Granting undocumented access
❌ Bypassing security defaults
❌ Verbal-only enablement

🔍 Governance & Auditability

Each onboarding has a checklist

Owner and timestamps recorded

Deviations documented and approved

Artifacts stored in GitHub or ticketing system

🏁 Outcome

After PHASE-33, LocalizeVideos achieves:

Predictable enterprise activations

Reduced onboarding risk
