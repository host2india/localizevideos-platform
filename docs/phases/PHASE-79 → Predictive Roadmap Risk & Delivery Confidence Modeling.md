🗺️ PHASE-79 — Predictive Roadmap Risk & Delivery Confidence Modeling

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 79 — Predictive Roadmap Risk & Delivery Confidence Modeling
Status: 🟡 Planned / Execution Intelligence & Delivery Governance
Environment: Production
Owner: Product, Engineering, Program Management, Executive Leadership
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Eliminate surprise delays, missed commitments, and roadmap instability by predicting delivery risk and confidence before execution begins, ensuring that:

Roadmaps reflect realistic delivery capacity

Leadership understands confidence levels, not just dates

Dependencies and bottlenecks are exposed early

Commitments are made with quantified certainty

Dates without confidence are guesses.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Roadmaps are probability distributions, not promises.

PHASE-79 ensures:

Every roadmap item has a confidence score

Risk is visible and measurable

Trade-offs are explicit before deadlines are set

Delivery trust compounds over time

🔍 Roadmap Risk Signal Inputs
Execution Signals

Historical delivery accuracy

Lead time variability

Cycle time distribution

Scope change frequency

Capacity Signals

Team availability

Parallel work limits

On-call and incident load

Technical debt burden

Dependency Signals

Cross-team dependencies

External vendor reliance

Platform and infra readiness

API and schema dependencies

Complexity Signals

Novel technology usage

Refactor vs greenfield

Security / compliance touchpoints

Testing and rollout complexity

Organizational Signals

Decision latency

Review and approval overhead

Context switching frequency

📊 Predictive Delivery Confidence Pipeline

Baseline

Historical delivery metrics by team and work type

Estimate

Scope size and complexity

Required effort and coordination

Predict

Delivery probability bands (P50 / P75 / P90)

Delay likelihood

Score

Delivery confidence score per roadmap item

Simulate

What-if scenarios (scope creep, incidents, attrition)

Decide

Commit

Re-sequence

De-scope

Delay

Review

Post-delivery accuracy and model tuning

🧮 Delivery Confidence Scoring
Confidence Band	Meaning
High (≥85%)	Safe to commit
Medium (60–85%)	Commit with buffer
Low (≤60%)	Do not commit
Critical (<40%)	Replan required

Only High and Medium confidence items appear in external roadmaps.

🛠️ Roadmap Governance Rules
Allowed

Confidence ranges instead of single dates

Explicit dependency mapping

Capacity buffers

Prohibited

Hard dates without confidence

Overlapping high-risk initiatives

Silent scope expansion

No roadmap item bypasses risk modeling.

🤖 Automation vs Human Judgment
Scenario	Handling
Risk scoring	Automated
Dependency detection	Automated
Commitment decision	Human-led
Executive trade-offs	Executive

Automation exposes truth.
Humans choose priorities.

📜 Reporting & Transparency

Dashboards include:

Roadmap confidence distribution

Risk heatmaps

Dependency bottlenecks

Forecast vs actual delivery accuracy

Trust trend over time

Reports are leadership-safe and externally defensible.

📈 Success Metrics

PHASE-79 is successful when:

Missed roadmap commitments decline

Confidence accuracy improves over time

Leadership trust increases

Teams push back on unsafe commitments

Roadmaps become boring (in a good way)

🧠 Cultural Rule

If a roadmap needs excuses later, risk was hidden earlier.
