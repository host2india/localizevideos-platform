Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 73 — Predictive Contract Risk & Enterprise Deal Governance
Status: 🟡 Planned / Enterprise Commercial Intelligence
Environment: Production
Owner: Legal, Sales Engineering, Finance, Executive Leadership
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Enable safe, scalable enterprise growth by predicting and governing contract risk before deals are signed, ensuring that:

High-risk clauses are identified early

Commercial commitments align with platform reality

Enterprise deals do not create hidden operational or legal debt

Revenue growth never outpaces governance maturity

A bad contract scales faster than a bad feature.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Contracts are operational promises, not just legal documents.

PHASE-73 ensures:

Every enterprise commitment is technically feasible

Legal, engineering, and finance share a single risk view

Deal velocity increases without sacrificing control

Long-term platform risk is priced, not ignored

🧮 Contract Risk Scoring Model
Risk Dimension	Weight
Legal exposure	High
SLA strictness	High
Technical customization	Medium
Revenue size	Medium
Strategic value	Contextual

High revenue does not excuse unbounded risk.

🤖 Automation vs Human Judgment
Scenario	Handling
Low-risk, standard deal	Automated
Medium-risk	Legal + finance review
High-risk	Executive decision
Novel risk	External counsel

Automation accelerates safe deals.
Humans decide strategic exceptions.

📜 Contract Lifecycle Governance

PHASE-73 governs:

Contract signing

Obligation tracking

SLA compliance monitoring

Renewal risk reassessment

Exit and termination planning

Contracts are actively managed, not archived.

📈 Success Metrics

PHASE-73 is successful when:

Enterprise deal cycle time decreases

Post-signature surprises approach zero

Legal escalations decline

Margin erosion is prevented

Platform commitments remain sustainable

🧠 Cultural Rule

If engineering learns about a contract obligation after signing, governance failed.
