🧠 PHASE-82 — Predictive Hiring, Attrition & Workforce Risk Intelligence

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 82 — Predictive Hiring, Attrition & Workforce Risk Intelligence
Status: 🟡 Planned / Workforce Intelligence & Risk Forecasting
Environment: Production
Owner: Engineering Leadership, HR (People Ops), Finance (FinOps), Executive
Last Updated: 2025-12-28

🎯 Objective

Prevent delivery failure caused by people risk by predicting:

Hiring needs before capacity collapse

Attrition risk before resignations happen

Skill gaps before roadmap damage

Workforce stress before burnout or churn

This phase ensures workforce decisions are proactive, not reactive.

Hiring late is expensive.
Attrition surprise is catastrophic.

PHASE-82 makes both predictable.

🧠 Core Philosophy

People risk is delivery risk.

PHASE-82 treats workforce health as a first-class system signal, not an HR afterthought.

This phase ensures:

Hiring happens ahead of demand

Attrition is forecast, not discovered

Skills evolve with roadmap needs

Leadership sees workforce risk early

📥 Workforce Risk Signal Inputs
Capacity & Load Signals

Sustained utilization > threshold

On-call fatigue

Incident frequency per engineer

Allocation churn (from PHASE-81)

Attrition Signals (Aggregate-Only)

Overtime trends

Role stagnation duration

Skill under-utilization

Repeated emergency delivery cycles

Hiring Signals

Forecasted roadmap demand

Skill scarcity index

Time-to-hire history

Cost of delay vs cost of hire

⚠️ No individual surveillance.
⚠️ Aggregate patterns only.

📊 Workforce Intelligence Pipeline

Observe
→ Detect stress patterns
→ Forecast attrition probability bands
→ Identify skill gaps
→ Simulate hiring scenarios
→ Recommend hiring windows
→ Review forecast vs reality

🧮 Predictive Hiring Model

For each skill domain:

Demand growth rate

Capacity deficit window

Hiring lead time

Cost of delay

Risk-adjusted urgency score

Output:

Hire now

Hire soon

Monitor

Do not hire

Hiring becomes economic timing, not panic.

🚦 Governance Rules

Allowed:

Risk-based hiring

Skill-driven workforce planning

Forecast-based budgeting

Prohibited:

Reactionary mass hiring

Ignoring sustained overload signals

Treating attrition as “personal failure”

No delivery plan may ignore workforce risk.

📈 Success Metrics

PHASE-82 is successful when:

Surprise attrition drops to near zero

Hiring lead time matches forecast

Delivery confidence improves

Burnout incidents reduce

Leadership never says “we didn’t see this coming”

🧠 Cultural Rule

If people leave suddenly, leadership wasn’t listening.
If hiring is always urgent, forecasting is broken.
