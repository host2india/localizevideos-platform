📜 PHASE-30 — Enterprise Contracting & SLAs

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 30 — Enterprise Contracting & SLAs
Status: 🟡 Planned → 🟢 Enforced
Environment: Production
Owner: Legal, Product & Platform
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Establish clear, enforceable, and scalable enterprise contracts and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that protect:

Customers

LocalizeVideos

Operational teams

Legal standing

This phase ensures that expectations are explicit, liabilities are bounded, and service guarantees are measurable.

If it is not contractually defined, it is not guaranteed.

🧠 Core Principles

Clarity over ambiguity

Measurable commitments only

No implied guarantees

Operational reality aligned with promises

Legal language reflects technical truth

Contracts must reflect what the platform actually does, not aspirational behavior.

🏢 Enterprise Customer Definition

An Enterprise Customer is any customer that:

Has a custom contract or MSA

Requires SLA-backed uptime

Requires data residency commitments

Requires audit, compliance, or legal assurances

Enterprise terms override standard self-serve terms only when explicitly signed.

📄 Contract Structure

Enterprise contracts must include:

1. Master Services Agreement (MSA)

Defines:

Scope of services

Legal relationship

Liability boundaries

Governing law

Termination rights

2. Statement of Work (SOW)

Defines:

Specific features or services

Custom requirements

Timelines

Commercial terms

3. Service Level Agreement (SLA)

Defines:

Availability commitments

Support response times

Remedies and credits

⏱️ SLA AVAILABILITY GUARANTEES
Standard Enterprise SLA
Metric	Commitment
Monthly Uptime	99.9%
Measurement Window	Calendar Month
Exclusions	Planned maintenance, force majeure

Uptime is measured at the API edge, not client devices.

Planned Maintenance

Scheduled with advance notice

Excluded from SLA calculations

Documented in status communications

📞 SUPPORT SLA TIERS
Severity Definitions

Severity 1 (Critical)

Platform unavailable

Authentication failure

Data loss risk

Severity 2 (High)

Core functionality degraded

Partial service outage

Severity 3 (Medium)

Non-core feature issues

Severity 4 (Low)

Questions, requests, clarifications

Response Targets
Severity	Initial Response	Resolution Target
Sev 1	≤ 1 hour	Continuous until resolved
Sev 2	≤ 4 hours	Best effort
Sev 3	≤ 1 business day	Scheduled
Sev 4	≤ 2 business days	Planned
💳 Service Credits (If Applicable)

Service credits:

Are the sole remedy for SLA breach

Are capped per billing period

Do not imply damages or refunds

Credits are applied to future invoices only.

🔐 Data Protection & Residency Clauses

Enterprise contracts must reference:

Approved data regions

Backup location policy

Cross-border transfer controls

Incident notification timelines

These must align with:

PHASE-29 — Data Residency & Sovereignty

⚖️ Liability & Indemnification

Contracts must explicitly define:

Liability caps

Excluded damages (indirect, consequential)

Customer responsibilities

Acceptable use obligations

No unlimited liability is accepted without executive approval.

📊 Audit & Compliance Rights

Enterprise customers may request:

Security documentation

Architecture overviews

Compliance attestations

Direct system access is never granted.

Audits are:

Time-bound

Scope-limited

Pre-approved

🚫 What Is NOT Guaranteed

❌ Feature availability beyond documented scope
❌ Zero downtime
❌ Client-side performance
❌ Third-party provider uptime
❌ Custom behavior without contract

Only written commitments apply.

🧾 Contract Change Management

Any change to:

SLAs

Data commitments

Support terms

Requires:

Written amendment

Legal review

Platform sign-off

No verbal or email-only changes are valid.

🔍 Review & Governance

Annual: Contract template review

Per deal: Legal + Platform approval

On incident: SLA impact assessment

Outdated contracts must be retired.

🏁 Outcome

After PHASE-30, LocalizeVideos achieves:

Predictable enterprise relationships

Enforceable service guarantees

Reduced legal ambiguity

Scalable sales enablement

Operational alignment with promises
