🎯 Objective

Protect and grow customer trust by predicting experience degradation and reputation risk before churn or public damage occurs, enabling:

Early detection of trust erosion

Proactive experience recovery

Reputation risk mitigation before escalation

Data-driven prioritization of customer-impact work

This phase ensures trust is managed as a measurable, forecastable asset.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Trust decays quietly before it collapses publicly.

PHASE-89 ensures:

Customer pain is detected early

Experience signals are correlated, not siloed
