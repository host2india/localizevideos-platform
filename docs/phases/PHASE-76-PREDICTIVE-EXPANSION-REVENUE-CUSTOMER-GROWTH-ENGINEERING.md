🎯 Objective

Systematically grow revenue from existing customers by predicting expansion opportunities before customers ask, ensuring that:

Upsell and cross-sell are timely and relevant

Expansion aligns with real usage and value delivered

Growth feels helpful, not sales-driven

Revenue growth is predictable and sustainable

The best expansion happens when customers realize value before sales speak.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Expansion is a signal of success, not pressure.

PHASE-76 ensures:

Growth is based on demonstrated product value

Expansion timing is data-informed

Customer trust is preserved

Revenue scales without increasing churn risk
