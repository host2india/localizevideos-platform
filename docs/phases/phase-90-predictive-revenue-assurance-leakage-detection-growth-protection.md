Phase: 90 — Predictive Revenue Assurance, Leakage Detection & Growth Protection
Status: 🟡 Planned / Revenue Intelligence & Financial Risk Prevention
Environment: Production
Owner: Finance (FinOps), Product, Engineering, Growth, Executive
Last Updated: 2025-12-28

🎯 Objective

Protect and maximize revenue by predicting revenue leakage, monetization failure, and growth risk before financial impact occurs, enabling:

Early detection of billing and pricing leakage

Prevention of silent revenue loss

Protection of expansion and upsell flows

Confidence in reported revenue numbers

This phase ensures every earned rupee is captured, protected, and grown.

🧠 Core Philosophy

Revenue rarely disappears suddenly — it leaks quietly.

PHASE-90 ensures:

Revenue risk is surfaced early

Monetization paths are continuously validated

Growth signals are protected from erosion

Leadership sees revenue risk in advance
