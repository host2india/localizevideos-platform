🚨 PHASE-55 — Executive Incident Response Playbook

Project: LocalizeVideos
Phase: 55 — Executive Incident Response Playbook
Status: 🟡 Planned / Governance
Environment: Production
Owner: Executive Leadership, Engineering Leadership, SRE
Last Updated: 2025-12-27

🎯 Objective

Provide executives with a clear, calm, and repeatable playbook for handling major production incidents without causing additional damage.

This phase ensures that leadership response reduces chaos, not amplifies it.

During incidents, leadership behavior matters as much as technical skill.

🧠 Core Principle

Executives do not run incidents — they enable resolution.

The primary executive responsibilities during incidents are:

Maintain clarity

Remove obstacles

Protect teams

Communicate responsibly

🚦 Incident Severity Awareness

Executives must understand severity levels:

Severity	Description	Executive Involvement
SEV-1	Full outage / data loss / security breach	Mandatory
SEV-2	Partial outage / degraded core feature	Required
SEV-3	Minor impact / workaround available	Informed only

Escalation rules must be respected.

🧭 Executive Role During an Incident
✅ What Executives MUST Do

Designate or confirm Incident Commander

Ask clarifying questions, not directive ones

Ensure teams have resources

Shield engineers from external pressure

Approve emergency actions if required

❌ What Executives MUST NOT Do

❌ Jump into technical decision-making
❌ Override incident command
❌ Demand immediate root cause
❌ Create side communication channels
❌ Assign blame

Executives must not become a second control plane.

🗣️ Communication Responsibilities
Internal Communication

Single source of truth

Calm, factual updates

Avoid speculation

No public statements without coordination

External Communication

Customer updates approved by incident command

Transparency without panic

Accuracy over speed

Silence is better than misinformation.

⏱️ Decision-Making Under Pressure

Executives may be asked to:

Accept temporary risk

Approve feature shutdowns

Greenlight rollbacks

Defer revenue-impacting actions

Decisions must be:

Explicit

Documented

Time-bound

🧯 Resource & Escalation Support

Executives are responsible for:

Clearing organizational blockers

Mobilizing additional teams

Approving vendor escalation

Managing external stakeholders

Teams should never fight politics during incidents.

🧠 Emotional Leadership

Incidents are stressful.

Executives must:

Model calm behavior

Avoid emotional reactions

Encourage rest after resolution

Reinforce psychological safety

Burning out teams during incidents is a leadership failure.

🔁 Post-Incident Responsibilities

After resolution, executives must ensure:

Blameless postmortem occurs

Action items are funded

Systemic issues are addressed

Lessons are shared

Skipping postmortems guarantees repeat incidents.

🧪 Preparedness & Drills

Executives must participate in:

Incident simulations

Tabletop exercises

Communication drills

Prepared leaders respond better than improvising ones.

🛑 Anti-Patterns (Explicitly Forbidden)

❌ Micromanagement during incidents
❌ Blame-focused questioning
❌ Side-channel communication
❌ Pressure for unrealistic ETAs
❌ Ignoring follow-up actions

🏁 Outcome

After PHASE-55, LocalizeVideos achieves:

Calm executive response under stress

Faster incident resolution

Reduced secondary damage

Higher team trust

Stronger customer confidence
